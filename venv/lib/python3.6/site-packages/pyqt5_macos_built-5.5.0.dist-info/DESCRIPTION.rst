This package installs a prebuilt version of PyQt5 for Mac OS. It does not
compile anything because uses an already precompiled one.

The main tools used to build PyQt5 depend on the package version:

    - 5.4.2.x: installs PyQt 5.4.2 built with SIP 4.16.8 and Python 3.4.3

Remember that Qt5 has to be installed already in your system in order to be
able to use PyQt5. On MAC OS, you can install Qt5 using brew:

    brew install qt5
